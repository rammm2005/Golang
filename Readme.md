# Run The Go Program 
```
go build
```
### We can use the LS operator to see the results
```
ls -l
```
## Now We can use This commmand to see the output
```
./name-of-go-file
```

## We can use the program with out the compilation (not recomended for new users it's just only used on development, but in case we have already in production we also need to Compile)
```
go run name-of-go-file.go
```
